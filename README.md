# empathy_study_public
Task code and analysis code for study on empathy. Pairs of subjects (one 'participant' and their 'companion') completed the task together. On each trial, one of them received an electric shock at one of three levels: high (painful), low (non-painful), or safe (no shock). Both participants then rated their emotional responses on a tablet.
